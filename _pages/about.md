I am a Reader of Mathematics at Cardiff University's School of Mathematics, where I am a member of the [Geometry, Algebra, Mathematical Physics & Topology](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/geometry-algebra-mathematical-physics-and-topology) (GAPT) group.

My research focuses on symmetries in the laws of physics. Such symmetries are fundamental to our understanding of the laws nature (they have arguably been the driving force behind almost all advances in theoretical physics for well over 100 years) and are also a source of beautiful mathematics. Specifically, I mainly study the mathematics of 2 dimensional conformal quantum field theories and all their myriad connections to Lie theory, vertex operator algebras, representation theory, modular forms and modular tensor categories to name but a few. Please see the [Research Section](/research/) for more details.

If you are a student who is interested in doing a summer project or a PhD with me, please see the Supervision Section.
